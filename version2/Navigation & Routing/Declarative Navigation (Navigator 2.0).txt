Use Navigator 2.0 (Direct API) if:
✔ You need full custom control over navigation.
✔ You are building a fully custom routing system (e.g., games, advanced navigation flows).

Is it necessary to learn Navigator 2.0?
No, it's not necessary to learn Navigator 2.0 if you're using go_router.
✅ go_router already handles Navigator 2.0 internally.
✅ You can build full-featured apps without ever touching Navigator 2.0.
✅ Learning go_router first is faster and practical for most Flutter projects.




Use go_router if:
✔ You want easy deep linking, web support, and query parameters.
✔ You prefer simple, declarative navigation instead of handling RouterDelegate.
✔ You are building a large app with structured navigation.
