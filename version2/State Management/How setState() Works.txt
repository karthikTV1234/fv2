1️. User Interaction Triggers a State Change
   Example: Button click increases a counter.

2️. You Call setState()
   Inside setState(), update the state variable.
setState(() {
  _counter++; // 🔼 Increase counter
});
3️. Flutter Marks the Widget as "Dirty"
   This means: "This widget needs to be rebuilt!"

4️. Flutter Schedules a UI Rebuild
   The build() method runs again, updating only the changed parts.

5️. New UI Appears
   The screen refreshes instantly with the updated state.
