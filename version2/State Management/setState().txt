What is setState()?
setState() is a method in StatefulWidget that tells Flutter to rebuild the UI when the state changes.

Why Do We Need setState()?
Flutterâ€™s UI is immutable. If we update a variable, the UI wonâ€™t change automatically.
setState() tells the framework:
ðŸ‘‰ "Hey, something changed! Rebuild the UI to reflect the new state."

setState() Syntax:
setState(() {
  // Update state variables here
  count++;
});
   The function inside setState() updates only the variables inside it.
   Flutter automatically rebuilds only the affected widgets.

Use Cases(When to Choose setState):


Common Mistakes When Using setState():
1. Calling setState() Without Changing the State.
2. Performing Heavy Computations Inside setState().
3. Overusing setState()
   For instance, avoid calling setState() in methods like build() or inside loops.
