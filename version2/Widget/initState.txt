In Flutter, @override void initState() is part of the StatefulWidget lifecycle and is used to initialize the state of a widget before it is built.


1. It is called exactly once when the widget is inserted into the widget tree.


Understanding the Code:
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState(); // Always call super.initState() first
}
  1. @override: This annotation tells Dart that we are overriding a method from the parent State class.
  2. void initState(): This function runs when the widget is created for the first time. You can use it to set things up before the screen appears.
  3. super.initState();: This ensures that the base class (State) properly initializes the widget before adding custom logic.


Why Use initState?
initState is useful when:

 Fetching data before the UI is built.
 Setting up event listeners or controllers.
 Initializing animations or database connections.
 Using Future operations that should run only once.
