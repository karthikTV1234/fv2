What is void main() in Flutter?
1️. main() Function in Flutter
   Every Flutter (and Dart) program starts execution from main().
   It is the entry point of the application.
2️. Syntax of main()
void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}
3️. Understanding runApp()
   runApp() tells Flutter which widget to load first.
   It takes a widget (usually MaterialApp, CupertinoApp, or any custom widget) and starts the app.
   Example:
   runApp(MyApp()); // MyApp is the root widget

   ✅ What happens when runApp(MyApp()) is called?
      Flutter initializes the widget tree and starts rendering.
      The MyApp widget is created and inserted as the root of the widget tree.
      The app's UI is built based on the widget tree.

5. Can main() Be Asynchronous?
Yes! If you need to do async setup (e.g., reading secure storage, initializing Firebase), use async in main().
runApp(MyApp()) runs synchronously, even inside an async main function.
