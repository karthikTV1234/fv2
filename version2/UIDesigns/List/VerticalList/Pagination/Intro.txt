What is API Pagination?
API pagination is a technique to fetch a limited set of data from a server instead of loading everything at once.
The server provides data in chunks (pages).

How Does It Work?
Initially, the app fetches page 1 from the API.
When the user scrolls to the end, the app requests page 2 and adds it to the list.
This continues until there is no more data available.
