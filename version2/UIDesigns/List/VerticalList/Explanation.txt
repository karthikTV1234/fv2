ListItemWidget:
Step1: Create a Stateless Widget
  StatelessWidget is used because the list item does not change dynamically.
  If the item needed to change (e.g., checkbox selection), we would use StatefulWidget.

Step2: Define Constructor with Required Parameters


Step3: Build Method (Returns UI)
   build(BuildContext context) → The main method that defines what this widget will look like.


Step4: Create a List Item with ListTile
    Add an Icon Using leading
    Define the Title and Subtitle
    Add a Right-Side Icon (trailing -> Displays an icon at the end of the list item)
    Handle Tap Actions


ListScreen:
Step1: Define the ListScreen Class with Stateless Widget
     ListScreen is a Stateless Widget because the list is fixed and does not change.
Step2: Create a Sample List of Items
Step3: Define a Function for Handling Taps
      _onItemTap is called when an item is tapped.
Step4: Implement the build Method
     build(BuildContext context) is the method that defines the UI for ListScreen.
Step5: Create the Scaffold Structure
     Create a Scrollable List Using ListView.builder
         itemCount: items.length → Tells how many items to display.
         itemBuilder → A function that builds each item dynamically.
     Return a Custom List Item Widget
