Types of ListView üõ†Ô∏è
ListView: A straightforward list of items.
ListView.builder: Creates items on demand to improve performance for large lists.
ListView.separated: Similar to ListView.builder, but with separators between items.
ListView.custom: Allows for more customization by using a SliverChildDelegate.


ListView:
When to use:
1. when you have a small number of items.
2. It constructs all children at once, which can be inefficient for long lists.

ListView.builder:
ListView.builder is perfect for long lists where items are created on demand. It takes two parameters: itemCount and itemBuilder.

itemCount: The number of items in the list.
itemBuilder: A function that returns a widget for each item in the list.


ListView.separated:
This type of ListView is similar to ListView.builder but allows you to add separators between items.
