We use the async to declare a function as an asynchronous function, and its return type is automatically converted to a Future of the return data type.

Why Future Builder

How FutureBuilder Works:
Takes a Future<T> (which represents an asynchronous operation).
Listens to the Future and waits for its result.
Rebuilds the UI based on the Future's state (loading, done, or error).


FutureBuilder Lifecycle & States

Basic Syntax

ðŸ”¹ When to Use FutureBuilder?
âœ… Fetching data from an API (http.get()).
âœ… Reading from local storage (e.g., SharedPreferences.getInstance()).
âœ… Database queries (e.g., sqflite.query()).
âœ… Any one-time async operation that affects UI.


Best Practices for FutureBuilder:
âœ… Use FutureBuilder only inside the widget tree to manage UI updates.
